# Simple Todo App

This is a lightweight Todo Manager that allows users to create, display, and remove tasks with optional due dates. Todos are fully interactive — they include completion toggling, validation, and dynamic UI rendering.

The Todo application provides the following features:

Add new tasks through a modal popup

Each task includes:

Task title

Optional due date (formatted using locale rules)

Completion checkbox

Delete button

Validation ensures user input is valid before submission

Existing tasks load from predefined initial data

Tasks dynamically render using reusable templates and OOP structure

## Technology
